<h2>A list of the 3 best movies I have watched</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Imitation Game</h3>
<p>This movie is about the life of the man who invented the first computer, in order to decrypt secret messages of the german army during WWII</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>This Christopher Nolan's classic is amazing just for the fact that it messes with your mind, making you wait for the end to see what's actually real</p>
<h3>On Time</h3>
<p>I particularly enjoyed this movie thanks to its extremely original plot</p>
